🧠 Solvex – 24-Hour Innovation Challenge | Solutions 2K25, Army Institute of Technology (AIT), Pune
Solvex is a 24-hour offline innovation challenge conducted under Solutions 2k25, the Army Institute of Technology (AIT) annual technical fest, Pune. This event 
brings together aspiring innovators, developers, and problem-solvers to tackle real-world challenges through technology-driven solutions.

🎯 Our Project: AI-Powered Log Management and Anomaly Detection System
Our team is developing an AI-powered Log Management and Anomaly Detection System that aims to automate log analysis, identify potential anomalies, and predict system 
failures. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Time-Series Analysis to analyze application logs and provide meaningful 
insights to enhance system performance.

🚀 Project Overview

📝 Problem Statement
Monitoring and analyzing application logs in large-scale applications is time-consuming and prone to human error. Manual log analysis makes detecting system 
anomalies difficult and predicting failures in real time. Our solution automates the log analysis process and improves system reliability by detecting anomalies 
and notifying relevant stakeholders.

🎯 Solution Approach
Our system aims to:
✅ Parse and analyze logs from multiple sources.
✅ Detect anomalies using AI/ML models trained on historical log data.
✅ Predict potential system failures using time-series models.
✅ Provide real-time alerts and notifications for critical issues.
✅ Visualize log data and system insights through interactive dashboards.

📌 Current Progress
✅ Problem Statement Defined
✅ Tech Stack Finalized
✅ Initial Log Parsing and Data Preprocessing Completed
⏳ Model Training and Evaluation (In Progress)
⏳ Dashboard Development (In Progress)
⏳ Real-Time Alerting System Integration (In Progress)
